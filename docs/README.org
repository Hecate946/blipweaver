* Motivation
- Nowadays, people struggle to connect with each other
- People are always wearing headphones/listening to music
- Yet people never seem to bond with others about music
- Music is popularized and pushed forth by media/masses
- Would like a better way of exploring genuine music taste

* Feature Map
** Scroll
- People love scrolling---implement a scrolling algorithm to find new music.
- Generic explore searching page
- Advanced filteration system to use the scrolling to explore specific paths
  down the graph. e.g. a genre or composer or instrumentation combo
  
** Graph
- Huge connection of all music-human related data
- Nodes will represent music tracks and people
- Genres will form clusters
- Composers will form clusters
- Instrumentation will form clusters
- People with be connected with others around them based on the tracks they
  like/interact with the most.
